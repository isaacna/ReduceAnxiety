# stress-less
A chrome extension to help with anxiety and track trigger times and events

## Instructions on Installation
Clone or download the repository onto your local computer. Then make sure to point your chrome browser to 'chrome://extensions' and enter developer mode. Press Load Unpacked Extension and load the downloaded repository into chrome. Click on the icon in the upper right hand corner (that looks like a puzzle piece) and enter the extension.
## Usage
When you initially begin the extension (for the very first time), press submit once to initialize the data with some example mock data to begin with. You can then choose your stress level and stressor tag and see the visualizations adjust in response.
